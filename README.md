## Findings and Hypothesis

### Bar Coupons

Based on the observations, some hypotheses can be made about drivers who accept the bar coupons.

Looking at the observational stats, the first thing calculation shows that drivers that go to bars more than three times a month have a higher rate of acceptance of the bar coupon at 76.88% vs 37.06% for drivers that go to bars less than 3 times a month. The hypothesis is that drivers that frequent bars more frequently will be more likely to accept bar coupons.

The next obsevation adds on age. We specifically look at drivers that go to bars more than once a month who are over 25 and whose who go to a bar less than once a month and are under 25. The findings were 69.52% and 39.33% coupon acceptance rate respectively. From this the hypothesis is that the drivers who go to bars at least one time a month and are over 25 are more likely to accept bar coupons.

Next we look at drivers who go to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry. From this, the coupon acceptance rate was 71.32%. The acceptance rate is still high so it can be hypothesized that drivers who do not have kids as passengers and do not have an occupation in farming, fishing, and forestry are more likely to accept bar coupons.

Lastly we look at acceptance rate for drivers in these three categories:
- Go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed with an acceptance rate of 71.32%.
- Go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 with an acceptance rate of 72.17%.
- Go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K with an acceptance rate of 45.35%.
From these observations, the age group of under 30 has a higher acceptance rate than previously seen with the age group of over 25. Also looking at the data for drivers who go to cheap restraunts frequently and have less than 50k income have a low acceptance rate of 45.35%.

In conclusion, with the data observed, an overall hypothesis for higher acceptance rate of bar coupons is that drivers who frequent bars more than once a month, under the age of 30, who do not have a kid as a passanger, and working in an occupation that is not farming, fishing, or forestry is more likely to accept a bar coupon.

### Coffee House Coupons

Hypothesis based on these obeservations: People who frequent coffee houses at least once a month are more likely to accept coffee house coupons. People frequent coffee houses at least once a month and are under 21 are more likely to accept coffee house coupons. People who frequent coffee houses at least once a month and are unemployed are more likely to accept coffee house coupons.
